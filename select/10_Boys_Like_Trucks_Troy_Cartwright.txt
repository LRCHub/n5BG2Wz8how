Boys like trucks
Like trucks like dirt
Like dirt likes boots
Like boots like work
Like a 5 O'clock friday
Likes a two week payday

Like the windows rolled down
Like a little gas money
Like alpine speakers
Like to play a little country
And girls like to turn it up
And that's why
Boys like trucks with a bench seat
With your hand on my knee
Down a two lane road
Going nice and slow
Rollin like a summer night breeze
Wouldn't hate it if we got stuck
Hey we could with some good luck
I'd be alright if we just sat tight
Cause you're lookin like a million bucks

Boys like trucks
Like trucks like dirt
Like dirt likes boots
Like boots like work
Like a 5 O'clock Friday
Likes a two-week payday

Like the windows rolled down
Like a little gas money
Like alpine speakers
Like to play a little country
And girls like to turn it up
And that's why boys like trucks

Yeah they do
And i like ridin around with you
