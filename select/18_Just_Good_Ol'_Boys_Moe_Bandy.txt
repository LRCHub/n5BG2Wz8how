(Ansley Fleetwood)

Well I've been kicked out of might near every bar around
I've been locked up for drivin' a hundred and twenty through town
Well I've been shot at and cut with a knife
For messing round with another man's wife
But other than that we ain't nothing just good ol' boys.

I threw my boss out a window and got fired from my last job
Hot wired a city truck and turned it over in the mayor's yard
Well I beat my brother-in-law half to death
I lost twenty bucks on his football bet
But other than that we ain't nothing just good ol' boys.

Good ol' boys we're all the same, ain't no way we'll ever change
Mean no harm by the things we do or the trouble that we get into
Other than a wild hair once in a while we can't help it it's just our style
And good ol' boys is all we'll ever be

I've got an alimony payment that's six weeks overdue
I got caught with a trunk full of bootleg out of state booze
I hocked my wife's diamond ring last June
Bought me an outboard Evinrude
But other than that we ain't nothing just good ol' boys.

Good ol' boys we're all the same, ain't no way we'll ever change
Mean no harm by the things we do or the trouble that we get into
Other than a wild hair once in a while we can't help it it's just our style
And good ol' boys is all we'll ever be

Good ol' boys is all we'll ever be...
