Boys like trucks like trucks like dirt
Like dirt likes boots like boots like work
Like a five o'clock Friday
Likes a two-week payday
Like the windows rolled down like
A little gas money
Like alpine speakers like to play a
Little country
And girls like to turn it up and that's why
Boys like trucks with a bench seat
With your hand on my knee
Down a two lane road, goin' nice and slow
Rollin' like a summer night breeze
Wouldn't hate it if we got stuck
Hey, we could with some good luck
I'd be alright if we just sat tight
Yeah, boys likе trucks like trucks like dirt
Like dirt likеs boots like boots like work
Like a five o'clock Friday

Like the windows rolled down like
A little gas money
Like alpine speakers like to
Play a little country
And girls like to turn it up and that's why
Boys like trucks
Yeah, they do
Oh yeah, I like ridin' around with you
Boys like trucks like trucks like dirt
